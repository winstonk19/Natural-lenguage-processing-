NLP YELP review classifier and topic Modeler As part of a Natural Language Processing sprint, I completed a project using a sample of the Yelp Review dataset, applying key NLP techniques
Tokenized raw Yelp reviews using spaCy.

Transformed text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF Vectorization.

Built a classification model to predict Yelp review star ratings.

Explored topics using LDA topic modeling with gensim.

Optimized a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier with a Pipeline and GridSearchCV.

Visualized topic distributions (using pyLDAvis).

This hands-on experience reinforced my ability to analyze unstructured text data, extract insights, and build predictive models in a real-world NLP context.

Tools Used: Python, spaCy, Gensim, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Pandas, TF-IDF, LDA, pyLDAvis
